Use the existing plan document you are asked to work on and dive in

Create an MD file for the implementation plan

Take the first undone MVP and break its tasks into implementation plans

Your goal is to define the architecture for the MVP

Chose the most appropriate elements for each requirement (e.g. a service, a component, directives, etc) and describe the relationships between them

Always use latest Angular API
See https://angular.dev for the latest API

Write your implementation plan below the MVP tasks

Use highlevel implementation details (e.g. "a class which...", "a directive called XXX which...")

Describe the moving parts but do not implement them, nor write their intended implementation in the document
