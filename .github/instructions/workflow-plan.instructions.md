Use the existing design document you are asked to work on and dive in

Create an MD file for the plan

Write the file to disk

Separate the design into smaller MVPs

For each MVP create clear tasks and subtasks with empty markdown checkboxes in the doc

Stay task oriented and avoid implementation details

Pass the document as input for the [plan implementation workflow](./.github/instructions/workflow-plan-implementation.instructions.md)
